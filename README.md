## Development

This project uses Docker Engine and Docker Compose for development and testing. Download and install Docker here:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

To prepare the development environment, execute the following. This will build and start the Rails server and Postgres database. After that, it creates the dev and test databases and runs migrations.
```bash
docker-compose up --build

docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare
```

To stop the containers if running in the background with the -d option, use:
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

Commands are executed on the "web" container using "docker-compose run web" followed by the commands to execute on the container.

To run tests with rspec if you are already running the containers:
```bash
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rspec
```

or to run tests when you need to start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose run web bundle exec rspec
```

## Production

Production secrets are stored as environment variables and not included in the repo. The following is a list of required variables:

**PUP-PUP-TRAINER-API_DATABASE_PASSWORD** : Postgres database password

## Continuous Integration

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ramillim/pup-pup-training-api) is used to automatically build all branches pushed to GitHub. The .circleci/config.yml file contains steps to submit the code coverage report generated by SimpleCov gem to [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ramillim/pup-pup-training-api/) for tracking.

You can also run CircleCI locally with the [CircleCI CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-jobs/) to validate changes to the configuration. Download and install the CLI tool using the link provided.
